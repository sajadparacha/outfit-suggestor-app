Excited to share my latest project: An AI-Powered Intelligent Outfit Suggestion System that combines advanced computer vision with multi-model generative AI! 🚀

I've developed a comprehensive fashion recommendation platform that uses GPT-4 Vision to analyze clothing images and generate personalized outfit suggestions. The system goes beyond simple recommendations by creating AI-generated model images showing how complete outfits look when worn!

✨ Key Innovations:

• Multi-Model AI Integration: GPT-4 Vision for intelligent clothing analysis, DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion for model image generation
• Smart Features: Completes partial outfits, respects wardrobe limitations, location-based customization, and perceptual hashing for duplicate detection
• Clean Architecture: MVC pattern with RESTful API, supports multiple platforms (Web & iOS), feature flags for controlled rollout

Try it yourself:
🔗 Standard Version: https://sajadparacha.github.io/outfit-suggestor-app/
🔗 Full Version (with Model Generation): https://sajadparacha.github.io/outfit-suggestor-app/?modelGeneration=true

Tech Stack: Python • FastAPI • React • TypeScript • PostgreSQL • OpenAI APIs (GPT-4 Vision, DALL-E 3) • Stable Diffusion • Tailwind CSS

This project showcases the power of combining multiple AI models to solve real-world problems, with careful attention to architecture, user experience, and cost optimization.

I'm always open to feedback and collaboration opportunities! Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss AI applications, full-stack development, or fashion tech.
