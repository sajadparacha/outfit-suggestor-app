🎉 I'm thrilled to announce a major milestone: I've successfully built and deployed a full-stack AI-powered fashion recommendation system that combines cutting-edge computer vision, multiple generative AI models, and intelligent optimization techniques!

🏆 What Makes This Special:

This isn't just another AI project - it's a complete, production-ready application that showcases my expertise across multiple domains:

✅ Advanced AI Integration: Seamlessly integrated GPT-4 Vision, DALL-E 3, and Stable Diffusion in a single application
✅ Intelligent Systems: Implemented perceptual hashing for duplicate detection, reducing API costs by preventing redundant processing
✅ Architecture Excellence: Built a clean MVC architecture with proper separation of concerns, supporting both web and iOS platforms
✅ Real-World Problem Solving: Created a system that actually understands fashion context, respects user constraints, and provides actionable recommendations

💡 The Technical Challenge:

Building a system that accurately preserves clothing details in AI-generated images while maintaining consistency across different AI models was no small feat. I solved this by:
• Using GPT-4 Vision to extract ultra-detailed descriptions
• Implementing sophisticated prompt engineering techniques
• Creating a hybrid approach that leverages each model's strengths
• Adding feature flags for controlled rollout and A/B testing
