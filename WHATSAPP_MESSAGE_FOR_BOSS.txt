Hey [Boss Name]! 👋

Just finished building something cool and wanted to share - an AI outfit suggestion app!

You upload a pic of any shirt/blazer and it suggests a complete matching outfit. Pretty handy! 😄

🔗 Check it out: https://sajadparacha.github.io/outfit-suggestor-app

Built with React + Python, and it's using OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision API to analyze the clothes and give fashion advice.

Code's all on GitHub too if you're interested:
