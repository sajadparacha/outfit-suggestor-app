  Run full web, backend, and iOS test suites; on success commit the current

  wants to ship the web app after tests pass.

# Publish on Web

End-to-end release workflow for **outfit-suggestor-app**: test → commit → push → GitHub Pages → Railway.

**Stop immediately** if any test suite fails. Do **not** commit, push, or deploy on failure.

---

## Trigger

User says:

```text
publish on web
```

or invokes this skill by name.

---

## Prerequisites (check before starting)

| Requirement | Check |
|-------------|--------|
| Clean intent | User invoked this skill (counts as explicit commit + push + deploy approval) |
| `gh` CLI | `gh auth status` — needed for push if HTTPS credential helper missing |
| Railway CLI | `railway --version` and `railway status` — project must be linked (`railway link`) |
| Node + Python venv | `frontend/node_modules`, `backend/venv` present |
| Xcode (iOS tests) | Simulator available; fallback name: `iPhone 17` |

If Railway is not linked, run `railway link` from repo root (user may need to approve in browser). If `frontend/.env.production` is missing, warn user that production build may use wrong API URL — do not create it with secrets unless user provides the Railway URL.

---

## Workflow checklist

```
- [ ] 1. Record branch name (`git branch --show-current`)
- [ ] 2. Run all test suites (gate)
- [ ] 3. If all pass → inspect changes, draft commit message
- [ ] 4. Stage, commit (exclude secrets & build artifacts)
- [ ] 5. Push current branch to origin
- [ ] 6. Publish GitHub Pages
- [ ] 7. Deploy backend to Railway
- [ ] 8. Verify deployments
- [ ] 9. Publish execution report to user
```

Optional fast gate script (tests only):

```bash
bash .cursor/skills/publish-on-web/scripts/run-all-tests.sh
```

---

## Step 1 — Run all tests (mandatory gate)

Run **all three** suites. Use generous timeouts (iOS ~5–10 min, backend ~4 min).

### Web

```bash
cd frontend && npm test -- --watchAll=false --passWithNoTests
```

### Backend

```bash
cd backend && . venv/bin/activate && pytest -q
```

### iOS

```bash
cd ios-client && xcodebuild test \
  -scheme OutfitSuggestor \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17' \
  -only-testing:OutfitSuggestorTests \
  -only-testing:OutfitSuggestorUITests
```

If simulator name fails, list devices: `xcrun simctl list devices available | grep iPhone` and retry.

**Gate rule:** Any failure → fix or report to user and **exit workflow**. No commit/push/deploy.

---

## Step 2 — Commit current branch

Follow git safety rules:

1. In parallel:
   - `git status`
   - `git diff` (staged + unstaged)
   - `git log -3 --oneline`
2. **Never stage:**
   - `.env`, `.env.*` with secrets (e.g. `frontend/.env.development`)
   - `ios-client/build-device/`, `**/xcuserdata/**`, `node_modules/`
   - `backend/venv/`, `__pycache__/`, `.pytest_cache/`
3. Draft a 1–2 sentence commit message from the diff (focus on **why**).
4. Commit with HEREDOC:

```bash
git add <relevant-files>
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Your message here.

EOF
)"
```

5. `git status` to confirm commit succeeded.

Do **not** amend unless a hook auto-modified files and rules allow it.

---

## Step 3 — Push to GitHub

```bash
git push -u origin HEAD
```

Use `required_permissions: ["all"]` / network if the environment blocks push.

Pushing **`main`** also triggers [.github/workflows/deploy.yml](../../../.github/workflows/deploy.yml) (GitHub Actions build → gh-pages).

---

## Step 4 — Publish GitHub Pages

From repo root:

```bash
cd frontend && npm run deploy
```

This runs `predeploy` (`npm run build`) then `gh-pages -d build`.

**Production API URL:** build reads `frontend/.env.production` (`REACT_APP_API_URL`). Ensure it points at the live Railway backend before deploy.

**Live URLs (this project):**

| Site | URL |
|------|-----|
| Custom domain | https://closiq.me |
| GitHub Pages | https://sajadparacha.github.io/outfit-suggestor-app |

---

## Step 5 — Deploy backend to Railway

From repo root (linked project required):

```bash
cd backend && railway up
```

Railway builds/deploys the Python backend (`backend/` root per project settings). Auto-deploy also occurs on push if the GitHub repo is connected in Railway dashboard.

**Verify:**

```bash
curl -s https://<your-railway-host>/health
```

Expect JSON with `"status":"healthy"`.

---

## Step 6 — Execution report (required)

Always post this summary to the user:

```markdown
## Publish on Web — Report

**Branch:** <branch>
**Overall:** SUCCESS | FAILED (stopped at <step>)

### Tests
| Suite | Result | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Web | PASS/FAIL | X suites, Y tests |
| Backend | PASS/FAIL | X passed |
| iOS | PASS/FAIL | X unit + Y UI |

### Git
- **Commit:** `<hash>` — <message>
- **Push:** origin/<branch> — OK / FAILED

### Deployments
| Target | Command | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| GitHub Pages | `npm run deploy` | OK / FAILED / SKIPPED |
| Railway | `railway up` | OK / FAILED / SKIPPED |
| GitHub Actions | push to main | triggered / N/A |

### Live checks
- Frontend: <URL> — HTTP status
- Backend /health: <URL> — response

### Notes
- Failures, skipped steps, or manual follow-ups
```

---

## Failure handling

| Failure | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Tests fail | Stop. Show failing test names. No deploy. |
| Nothing to commit | Skip commit; ask user if they still want push/deploy. |
| Push rejected | Report error; do not deploy. |
| `npm run deploy` fails | Report; backend may still be on Railway from prior deploy. |
| `railway up` fails | Report; suggest `railway status` and dashboard logs. |
| Not logged into Railway | `railway login` then retry. |
