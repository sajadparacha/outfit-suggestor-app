# Enable GitHub Pages - Step by Step

## ⚠️ You're seeing 404 because GitHub Pages isn't enabled yet!

### Follow these exact steps:

1. **Go to your repository:**
   https://github.com/sajadparacha/outfit-suggestor-app

2. **Click on "Settings"** (top navigation bar)

3. **Scroll down to "Pages"** (left sidebar, under "Code and automation")

4. **Under "Build and deployment":**
   - **Source:** Select **"GitHub Actions"** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
   
5. **Click "Save"** (if there's a save button)

6. **Go to "Actions" tab:**
   https://github.com/sajadparacha/outfit-suggestor-app/actions

7. **Check if the workflow ran:**
   - If you see a workflow run, click on it to see the status
   - If it failed, click "Re-run all jobs"
   - If there's no workflow, we need to trigger one

8. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment to complete

9. **Visit:** https://sajadparacha.github.io/outfit-suggestor-app

## Alternative: Manual Deploy

If the automatic deployment doesn't work, run this command:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run deploy
```

This will build and deploy your frontend directly to GitHub Pages.
