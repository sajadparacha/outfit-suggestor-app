OPTION 1: FRIENDLY & CASUAL
----------------------------------------

Hey [Name]! 👋

I need your help with something exciting! 

I've built an AI-powered fashion app that suggests complete outfits based on your clothing photos. Think of it as your personal AI stylist! 🤖👔

🎯 What it does:
• Upload a photo of any shirt/blazer (or take one with your camera)
• Get instant AI recommendations for matching pants, shoes, belt, and styling tips
• Super fast and easy to use

🔗 Try it here: https://sajadparacha.github.io/outfit-suggestor-app

🙏 I'd love your feedback after using it for 10 days:
- Is it helpful?
- What features would you want?
- Any bugs or issues?
- Would you actually use this regularly?

⚠️ IMPORTANT - CONFIDENTIAL:
Please DO NOT share this link or discuss the idea with anyone else. This is in early beta and I'm only sharing with a few trusted people for honest feedback before launch.

Just use it normally whenever you're picking outfits and let me know your thoughts after 10 days!

Thanks for being part of this! 🙌
