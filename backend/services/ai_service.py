           - Primary color: Use SPECIFIC color names (e.g., "navy blue", "burgundy", "charcoal gray", "forest green", "royal blue", "crimson red", NOT generic "blue" or "red")
           - Color shade/intensity: Describe EXACT shade (e.g., "deep navy blue", "light sky blue", "dark charcoal gray", "bright cherry red", "olive green")
           - If multiple colors: List EACH color with its EXACT shade and location
           - Color saturation: Describe if colors are vibrant, muted, pastel, etc.
           - Any color gradients or variations: Describe EXACTLY how colors transition
           - IMPORTANT: If the shirt is blue, say "blue" AND the exact shade (e.g., "navy blue", "sky blue", "royal blue"). Do NOT just say "blue".
        
        3. PATTERN DETAILS (IF APPLICABLE):
           - Pattern type: State clearly (solid, stripes, checks, plaid, dots, geometric, etc.)

             * Pattern size and spacing
             * Pattern colors
             * Pattern arrangement
        
        4. MATERIAL/TEXTURE APPEARANCE:

           - Cut: Style (tailored, casual, athletic, etc.)
        
        7. DISTINCTIVE FEATURES:
           - Logos/Branding: Describe any logos, emblems, or brand markings exactly (location, size, colors)
           - Embroidery: Any embroidery or decorative stitching (describe pattern, colors, location)
           - Buttons: Material, color, style (if distinctive)
           - Unique elements: Any other unique design features
           - Text: Any visible text (quote exactly, including font style if noticeable)
        
        8. OVERALL CHARACTERISTICS:
           - Style category: (formal, business, casual, sporty, etc.)
           - Any distinctive characteristics that make this item unique
        
        CRITICAL RULES FOR YOUR DESCRIPTION:
        - COLORS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT: Use SPECIFIC color names with exact shades (e.g., "navy blue" not "blue", "burgundy red" not "red", "charcoal gray" not "gray")
        - If you see blue, identify the EXACT shade: navy blue, sky blue, royal blue, powder blue, etc.
        - If you see red, identify the EXACT shade: burgundy, crimson, cherry red, scarlet, etc.
        - Describe ONLY what you actually see - do not infer or assume
        - Be PRECISE about patterns - include measurements, spacing, directions
        - Include ALL visible details - nothing is too small to mention
        - Do NOT suggest improvements, changes, or alternatives
        - Do NOT generalize - be specific about every aspect
        - If uncertain about a detail, describe what you can clearly see
        
        FINAL REMINDER: Colors are CRITICAL. If the shirt is blue, you MUST specify the exact shade of blue. 
        DALL-E will use your exact words, so "blue" will give a generic blue, but "navy blue" will give navy blue.
        Your description must be detailed enough that DALL-E can recreate this EXACT clothing item with 100% color accuracy.
        Be thorough, specific, and accurate - especially with colors.
